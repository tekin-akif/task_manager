Next Steps (When You’re Ready):
-Test All Pages (Calendar, Overdue, Planning) to ensure tasks sync correctly.

-Polish UI/UX (e.g., loading states, error messages, success notifications).

-Enhance Validation (e.g., prevent duplicate IDs, enforce date formats).

-Auto-Status Updates (mark tasks as late at midnight).

-Add Features (task deletion confirmation, drag-and-drop, etc.).
